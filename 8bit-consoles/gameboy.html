            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Game Boy was Nintendo's first attempt at a handheld console. There are many versions in the Game Boy family of consoles such as the Pocket Game Boy, Game Boy Light, and Game Boy Color. Each of these was assigned a three letter code name internally at Nintendo. For example, the Game Boy Color has the code name CGB. The DMG was the very first of these consoles. (DMG stands for Dot Matrix Grid which refers to the monochrome LCD screen of the Game Boy.)</p>

            <h2>Specs</h2>
            <p>Unlike the NES which used a commercial processor for the CPU, the Game Boy used a custom processor. The architecture and instruction set of this processor was very similar to the Z80 chip. Being a handheld console, the Game Boy had integrated speakers, controls, and display components. The screen had a resolution of 160x144 and only four monochrome colors. It also had an integrated RAM size of 8KB. While successive models of the Game Boy made minor improvements to form factor and functionality, the underlying hardware stayed mostly the same. The Game Boy Color changed this by introducing new colors, more RAM, and a faster CPU to the console while still maintaining backwards compatability. To achieve this, some games contained special information that allowed them to detect and access these special features when played on a Game Boy Color.</p>
