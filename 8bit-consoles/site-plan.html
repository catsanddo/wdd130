      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To inform and educate about the hardware of 8 bit "retro consoles" including the NES and Game Boy.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>A wide age range of people interested in old hardware and tech. Usually people who grew up with this hardware or really young people (ages 14-18) are most likely to be interested. This site will provide mostly entry level information and provide links to more in-depth resources, so technical experts are NOT in the intended audience.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Retro consoles were much less powerful than the ones we have today, but these limitations lead to a fanscinating environment of complex and clever hardware and software. Two great examples of this are the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) and Game Boy.

      <h3>NES</h3>
      <h4>History</h4>
      <p>
        The Nintendor Entertainment System was Nintendo's first console released in America. It is actually the American counterpart to the Famicon (a combination of the phrase "family computer"), but the hardware for both consoles were nearly identical, so the NES will be focused on here.
      </p>
      <h4>Specs</h4>
      <p>
        At the heart of the NES was the 6502 CPU. Used in many computers at the time it was a popular yet simple 8 bit processor. The NES actually contains two additional processors used for video and audio processing aside from the CPU. By default the NES had only 2KB of RAM to work with which is astonishingly low compared to the multiple gigabytes of today. Though it had extreme memory limitations within the console itself, it was actually possible for the game cartridges to contain additional RAM which could be exposed to the rest of the console. Many games made use of their cartridges to upgrade the capabilities of the console in a variety of ways.

      </ul>
      <h3>Game Boy</h3>
      <h4>History</h4>
      <p>
        The Game Boy was Nintendo's first attempt at a handheld console. There are many versions in the Game Boy family of consoles such as the Pocket Game Boy, Game Boy Light, and Game Boy Color. Each of these was assigned a three letter code name internally at Nintendo. For example, the Game Boy Color has the code name CGB. The DMG was the very first of these consoles. (DMG stands for Dot Matrix Grid which refers to the monochrome LCD screen of the Game Boy.)
      </p>
      <h4>Specs</h4>
      <p>
        Unlike the NES which used a commercial processor for the CPU, the Game Boy used a custom processor. The architecture and instruction set of this processor was very similar to the Z80 chip. Being a handheld console, the Game Boy had integrated speakers, controls, and display components. The screen had a resolution of 160x144 and only four monochrome colors. It also had an integrated RAM size of 8KB. While successive models of the Game Boy made minor improvements to form factor and functionality, the underlying hardware stayed mostly the same. The Game Boy Color changed this by introducing new colors, more RAM, and a faster CPU to the console while still maintaining backwards compatability. To achieve this, some games contained special information that allowed them to detect and access these special features when played on a Game Boy Color.
