            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Nintendo Entertainment System was Nintendo's first console released in America. It is actually the American counterpart to the Famicon (a combination of the phrase "family computer"), but the hardware for both consoles were nearly identical, so the NES will be focused on here.</p>

            <h2>Specs</h2>
            <p>At the heart of the NES was the 6502 CPU. Used in many computers at the time it was a popular yet simple 8 bit processor. The NES actually contains two additional processors used for video and audio processing aside from the CPU. By default the NES had only 2KB of RAM to work with which is astonishingly low compared to the multiple gigabytes of today. Though it had extreme memory limitations within the console itself, it was actually possible for the game cartridge to contain additional RAM which could be exposed to the rest of the console. Many games made use of their cartridge to upgrade the capabilities of the console in a variety of ways.</p>
